# ExVectrSensor
Part of the ExVeCtr project. 
ExVectrSensor offers multiple sensor interface classes and sensor implementations. 

Everything inside the ExVectrSensor folder is an interface. Inside the Sensors folder are the sensor implementations.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
## Current goal roadmap:
- [ ] Plan interfaces.
- [ ] Implement sensors I currently have like BME280, MPU9250 etc.
- [ ] Documentation.
