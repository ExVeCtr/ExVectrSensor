# ExVectrSensor
Part of the ExVeCtr project. 
ExVectrSensor offers multiple sensor interface classes and sensor implementations. 

Everything inside the ExVectrSensor folder is an interface. Inside the Sensors folder are the sensor implementations.
## Dependencies:
The ExVectr libraries below are required by this library to function.
- Core 
- HAL
- Math
## Current goal roadmap:
- [X] Plan interfaces.
- [X] Implement MPU9250
- [X] Implement BME280
- [X] Implement QMC5883
- [ ] Implement UBLOX GPS (M8Q for testing)
- [ ] Reduce MPU9250 read overhead and specific sensor read and not always all.
- [ ] Documentation.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
